# Caesar Cypher

This project implements the Caesar Cypher.
The programm reads text from a given file and performs one of the 3 functions. The functions are: encryption, decryption and brute force. Encryption changes the text, according to the previously given key, while decryption deciphers the text using the given key. Brute force analyzes the text and returns a key for decryption and the decrypted text.
